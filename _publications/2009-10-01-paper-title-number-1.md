excerpt: 'In this paper, a joint designof the unmanned aerial/surface/underwater vehicle (UAV-USV-UUV) network, also referred to as 3U network, is proposed for cooperative underwater target hunting. We first introduce the advantages of this 3U heterogeneous system in multi-task cooperation and portray its system model. Moreover, we propose an energy-oriented target hunting model by jointly optimizing the UAV’s position, the UUV’s trajectory as well as their inter-connectivity. Finally, DQN algorithms are conceived to solve the proposed target hunting problem. Simulation results show the proposed scheme is suitable for underwater target hunting with a high success rate considering a trade-off between the system energy consumption and inter-connectivity.'
